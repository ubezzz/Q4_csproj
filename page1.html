            <h1>REASON FOR RUNNING</h1> <br>
            <p>The reason I’m running for this position is as simple as wanting to help our batch as I’ve been helping and leading the batch the best way I can. Having the opportunity to be batch governor now can help me achieve my goals to lead our batch, as the batch is really in need of a persevering leader. As we are halfway through high school and are about to face a number of forms, requirements, research, and electives, it would be best if the batch would have a leader who is willing and ready to face all these responsibilities with dedication and a sense of accountability, as well as someone who could encourage them to learn more about themselves by allowing them to go out of their comfort zones. For the batch, I am not just a leader but also a friend to all. And I will continue to be the leader and friend I am by being a listener and being the voice of the batch.</p>
