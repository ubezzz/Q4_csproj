            <p> <b>As batch governor I aim to:</b> <br><br>               
                </p>
                <ol>
                    (1) Uphold direct and proper communication for the batch and teachers through batch meetings and batch consultations.
                </ol> <br>
                <ol>
                    (2) Improve necessary aspects of the batch committees that were previously implemented and this involved better task distribution, information dissemination, and a better budgeting and funding for the batch.
                </ol> <br>
                <ol>
                    (3) Another concern is that there is still quite a number of batchmates that were not fully informed about what we should be preparing for in our succeeding years. So, I will organize an information dissemination focused on our SIP and SYP requirements. Ensuring that each batchmate will receive the help they need in processing and preparing for their SIP and other requirements.
                </ol> <br>
                <ol>
                    (4) I will prioritize the well-being of our batch. As well as maintaining good relations, not only within our batch but as well as our relations with our juniors and seniors.
